understand about model, view, controller and how these interact with each other.
routing from the program.cs file for different controller.
also learned how to add anything in main screen from shared layout in view.
also learned about root folder
and how to display static file from root folder and from outside the root folder.


Note: shared layout is for everything so if u want to apply css on full container i.e everything then 
use its CSS file otherwise use root css file if and link it to each view method of which u want to 
change the CSS.
